What is PalPet?

Palpet is an application on the iPhone that allows users to take care of their own personal virtual pet. Created utilizing Swift and UIKit, users can play a minigame with the pet, shop for food and feed the pet, and even have the weather and background change based on the weather at their current location. Real time weather information is retrieved from a third party API.
